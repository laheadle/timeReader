      It was thus in our country. The line which bounded the royal prerogative,
      though in general sufficiently clear, had not everywhere been drawn with
      accuracy and distinctness. There was, therefore, near the border some
      debatable ground on which incursions and reprisals continued to take
      place, till, after ages of strife, plain and durable landmarks were at
      length set up. It may be instructive 1166 to note in what way, and to what
      extent, our ancient sovereigns were in the habit of violating the three
      great principles by which the liberties of the nation were protected.

      Argyle escaped in disguise to England, and thence passed over to
      Friesland. In that secluded province his father had bought a small estate,
      as a place of refuge for the family in civil troubles. It was said, among
      the Scots that this purchase had been made in consequence of the
      predictions of a Celtic seer, to whom it had been revealed that Mac Callum
      More would one day be driven forth from the ancient mansion of his race at
      Inverary. <a href="#linknote-335" name="linknoteref-335" id="linknoteref-335"><small>335</small></a> But it is probable that the
      politic Marquess had been warned rather by the signs of the times than by
      the visions of any prophet. In Friesland Earl Archibald resided during
      some time so quietly that it was not generally known whither he had fled.
      From his retreat he carried on a correspondence with his friends in Great
      Britain, was a party to the Whig conspiracy, and concerted with the chiefs
      of that conspiracy a plan for invading Scotland. <a href="#linknote-336" name="linknoteref-336" id="linknoteref-336"><small>336</small></a> This
      plan had been dropped upon the detection of the Rye House plot, but became
      again the Subject of his thoughts after the demise of the crown.
